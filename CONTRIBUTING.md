##Release Process

Relase Python package
=====================

We use `bump2version <https://pypi.org/project/bump2version/>`_ to manage version numbers.
To tag a release run::

    $ bumpversion release

This will remove the ``.dev0`` suffix from the current version, commit, and tag the release.

To switch back to a development version run::

    $ bumpversion --no-tag [major|minor|patch]

specifying ``major``, ``minor`` or ``patch`` depending on whether the development branch will be a `major, minor or patch release <https://semver.org/>`_. This will also add the ``.dev0`` suffix.

Remember to ``git push`` all commits and tags.
